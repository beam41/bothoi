A Discord bot for myself

## Why I do this?

I want to learn some pretty advanced Golang,
and at the same time my server discord bot randomly decide to not play YouTube video anymore,
so I made one myself.

## Why don't you use any sdk like discordgo, disgo, disgord, arikawa, disgolink, waterlink, Lavalink.

I just doesn't want to. (lol) I want to learn advanced Golang,
have to connect websocket and udp is really hard, especially when I never connect ones before.

Downside is I have to read Discord API to properly connect ws and udp, which is also hard.


## Can I use it

I don't mind, but you probably have better time using any sdk I mention above.
